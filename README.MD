# Python_Project-Caesar_Cipher
* The project is similar to Caesar Cipher project in my previous project in JavaScript/Ruby/Python, but this time it is written in C++ and is first written in a compiled language.
* As for refreshing for my C++ skills, I create this project to prepare myself to learn Data Structure and Algorithms using C/C++.
* Nothing much different from Caesar Cipher project in my previous project but I think it's easier to convert between ASCII characters/decimal in C/C++.
